I've observed many immigrants and international students grappling with mental health challenges, from depression to homesickness and culture shocks. Given the high costs of mental health care—up to $250 per hour or approximately $10,086 annually—it's often unaffordable for them. Additionally, language and cultural barriers exacerbate these challenges.

To address this, I developed a platform with two colleagues that connects these individuals with mental health professionals from their homeland to mitigate cost, language, and culture issues. This prototype features user authentication, profile building, appointment booking (with updates and cancellations), notifications, a resource center, and detailed profiles for mental health experts. Although currently non-functional due to the use of free deployment services, it is a promising project patented under my name.
